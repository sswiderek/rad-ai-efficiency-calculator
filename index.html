      <h3>Steps to Use:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Input Your Practice Details 🏥
          <p>Enter the number of radiologists, average reports per day, time per report, and radiologist salary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>See Your Savings 📊
          <ul>
            <li>Total Time Saved ⏱</li>
            <li>Annual Cost Savings 💰</li>
            <li>Additional Reports Completed 📈</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Assumptions Made ⚙️</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⏱ <b>Time Saved:</b> The calculator assumes that Rad AI can reduce report completion time by up to 35%, based on industry data indicating that AI-assisted reporting significantly reduces repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li>💰 <b>Cost Savings:</b> Savings are calculated based on the average annual salary of a radiologist and the time saved through automation. The average hourly wage is derived from the annual salary divided by 2,080 hours (standard full-time work year).</li>
        <li>📅 <b>Working Days Per Year:</b> The calculator assumes 250 working days per year, accounting for weekends and holidays.</li>
        <li>📈 <b>Report Volume:</b> Estimates are based on typical daily report volumes for radiologists, which vary based on specialty, practice size, and geographic location.</li>
        <li>📊 <b>Scalability:</b> The time and cost savings scale with the size of the practice, meaning larger practices with more radiologists will see higher absolute savings.</li>
